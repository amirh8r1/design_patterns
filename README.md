# Design Patterns Implementation

Welcome to the Design Patterns Implementation repository! This project contains implementations of various design patterns in Python. Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in software design, and they can help make your code more flexible, reusable, and maintainable.

## Introduction

This repository contains implementations of several well-known design patterns. Each pattern is implemented with clear and concise code examples to help you understand how they work and how to use them in your own projects.

## Creational Patterns

### Singleton
Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

### Factory Method
Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.

### Abstract Factory
Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

### Prototype
Specifies the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and creates new objects by copying this prototype.

### Builder
Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create various representations.

## Structural Patterns

### Adapter
Allows incompatible interfaces to work together by converting the interface of a class into another interface the clients expect.

### Decorator
Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically, providing a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

### Facade
Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem, making the subsystem easier to use.

### Proxy
Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

### Composite
Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies, allowing clients to treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.

### Bridge
Decouples an abstraction from its implementation, allowing the two to vary independently.

## Behavioral Patterns

### Chain of Responsibility
Passes a request along a chain of handlers, allowing multiple objects a chance to handle the request.

### Command
Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.

### Observer
Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

### Mediator
Defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact, promoting loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly.

### Template Method
Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses without changing the algorithm's structure.

### Strategy
Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.

### State
Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes, appearing to change the class of the object.

### Memento
Captures and externalizes an object's internal state without violating encapsulation, allowing the object to be restored to this state later.

### Visitor
Represents an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure, allowing you to define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.
